Python 3.6
keras 2.3.1
tensorflow 1.15
numpy 1.16.5

1) Download the Imdb dataset
```
./download_dataset.sh
```

2) Download the glove vector embeddings (used by the model)
```
 ./download_glove.sh 
```

3) Download the counter-fitted vectors (used by our attack)
```
./download_counterfitted_vectors.sh 
```

4) Build the vocabulary and embeddings matrix.
```
python build_embeddings.py
```

That will take like a minute, and it will tokenize the dataset and save it to a pickle file. It will also compute some auxiliary files like the matrix of the vector embeddings for words in our dictionary. All files will be saved under `aux_files` directory created by this script.

5) Train the sentiment analysis model.
```
python train_model.py
```

6)Download the Google language model.
```
./download_googlm.sh
```

7) Pre-compute the distances between embeddings of different words (required to do the attack) and save the distance matrix.

```
python compute_dist_mat.py 

make sure you have at least 16gbs of RAM. This takes up all your RAM.

```
8) Now, we are ready to try some attacks ! You can do so by running the `AttackDemo.ipynb` jupyter notebook !
